          <p>My coaching is based on positive psychology, a branch of psychology that studies what causes people to thrive
          in their lives and work, and how we can apply those findings in practical ways.</p>
          <p>My approach as a coach is to focus on building on the things that are in our control and empower us, such
          as our strengths and understanding at our core what motivates us.</p>
          <p>If you're considering changes in your life or work, or pursuing a significant goal, I believe you'll find my
          knowledge of positive psychology and my evidence-based approach can help you get the results you want.</p>

          <p>I came to this work after extensive study of positive psychology theory and practice, and following years
          spent working as a teacher and in political organizing.</p>
          <p>I hold a BA from Georgetown University and a MS in Education from Fordham University. I've studied positive
          psychology and the science of effective coaching under Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar, earning a Certificate
          in Positive Psychology from the WholeBeing Institute. At the WholeBeing Institute I also received instruction
          as part of the Positive Psychology Coach Training course.</p>
