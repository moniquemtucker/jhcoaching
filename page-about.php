          <p>Learning in our world has traditionally been about adding information, but in our complex, fast-paced culture we 
            can get lost in too much information, too many options. What is just as important is knowing what to subtract.</p>
          <p>Thankfully, research exists to help us remove the clutter and gain clarity on how we best function. 
            My coaching is based on positive psychology, a branch of psychology that studies what causes people to thrive in their lives and work.</p>
          <p>I created my career and life coaching practice because I want to use the latest science to help people gain 
            a deep understanding of their strengths and values, so they can choose the goals that are right for them.</p>

          <p>If you're feeling stuck in your life or work, I believe you'll find my knowledge of positive psychology 
            and my evidence-based approach can help.</p>
          <p>I came to this work after extensive study of positive psychology theory and practice, and following years 
            spent working as a teacher and in political organizing.</p>
          <p>I have a BA from Georgetown University and a MS in Education from Fordham University. I studied positive 
            psychology under Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar, earning a Certificate in Positive Psychology from the WholeBeing Institute, 
            where I also received instruction as part of the Positive Psychology Coach Training course.</p>
